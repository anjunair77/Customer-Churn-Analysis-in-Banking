## 🧠 Objective
Analyze customer churn data for a fictional bank to identify factors influencing customer attrition and generate actionable insights using SQL.

## 📊 Dataset
Synthetic dataset of 1,000 bank customers with fields including:
- Age, Gender
- Tenure with bank
- Account balance and estimated salary
- Number of products held
- Credit card ownership
- Active membership status
- Churn flag (1 = churned, 0 = retained)

## 🔍 Key Questions Answered (via SQL)
- What is the overall churn rate?
- How does churn vary by gender, tenure, and product usage?
- Are active members less likely to churn?
- Do customers with credit cards or higher balances churn less?

## 🧩 Key Findings
- Churn rate is higher among customers with low tenure (< 2 years)
- Inactive members are over 2x more likely to churn
- Customers with only 1 product are more likely to leave the bank

## 💡 Recommendations
- Focus retention strategies on newer, inactive customers
- Encourage multi-product adoption via incentives
- Improve onboarding for customers in the first 2 years

## ⚙️ Tools Used
- SQL (for data analysis)
- Python (for data generation)
